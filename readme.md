# I Like What I See

_I Like What I See_ is a Chrome extension to automatically click all "Like"
buttons on Facebook. This project is a few things, one of which is a response
to the company's [response](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/08/facebook-puts-fraudulent-likes-on-notice/)
to "fradulent Likes." There are of course fradulent "Likes" but what about
inauthentic "Likes?" If the number of "Likes" for a brand, product or picture
of food is meant to imbue importance on that post surely a computer "liking"
the post eats away at this but what about a human clicking the "Like" button
without _really_ "liking" what they click on?

And what the heck does "like" mean?

"I like it."

"I _like_ it."

"_I_ like it."

The "Like" button is expressionless, people are expressive. Yet this button
allows us to appear expressive through a very impersonal response. When someone
posts about having a bad day, or being sick, there is no "Sorry" button.

In thinking about what it means to "Like" something on Facebook and that the
company was trying to crack down on fake "Likes" I started this project.

## A Script and a Human

_I Like What I See_ is a browser extension yes, but it's also me clicking the
Like button every time I see it when scrolling through Facebook. If Facebook
shuts down my script, I'll keep "Liking" everything myself...for a while at
least.

Is it a script or a person that is clicking "Like" and if it's a person, do
they _really_ "Like" it? I mean "like Like" it.

## So What

So am I just terrorizing your news feed or is this a meaningful thing I'm
trying to draw attention to? Maybe both, maybe neither. I'll quiet down in a
few days or weeks and maybe you might think about some of this.

I quit Facebook in June of 2011 and just rejoined a few weeks ago.
It was a complete deletion of my account. There were reasons for me to quit but
also reasons that I rejoined. Facebook is useful and has value, but we should
be thoughtful of what we're doing with Facebook and on Facebook.
